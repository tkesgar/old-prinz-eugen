Representing the Kriegsmarine/Nazi Germany Navy, the Ironblood is a member of
the "Crimson Axis" alliance with the Sakura Empire, and they have the least
number of ships available among the four major factions in the game. Ironblood
ships have a military theme with their outfits, reflecting the militarist
presence in Nazi Germany during World War II, and they specialize in
armor-piercing damage that deals heavy damage to bigger enemy ships. A common
trait is their rigging either having some sort of monstrous traits, most
prominently, a split in the hull of their rigging that resembles a Jagged Mouth
(which ranges from cute on their destroyers to outright monstrous on their heavy
cruisers, battleships, battlecruisers, and carriers) or being a bit of a
*CuteMonsterGirl*. Some of their ships such as Z46 and Prinz Eugen have some of
the highest HP and defense stats in the game for their ship type, and their
torpedoes are the only ones in the game with the Lock On attribute.

Previously, like the Eagle Union, they did not have much of a single faction
focus due to their small fleet size compared to the other three main factions.
This let them mix and match well with ships from other factions by providing
defense, homing torpedoes, and AP damage and a few unusual units.

After the introduction of more ships with faction abilities or benefits such as
Bismarck and Zeppy, it is now arguable they might have as much of a faction
focus as the Royal Navy.
